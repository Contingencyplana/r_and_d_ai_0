# War Office - Civilian Oversight Hub
**Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
**Mandate:** Keep High Command, Toyfoundry, Toysoldiers, and allied fronts aligned with the War Office doctrine of Love · Light · Safety · Sanity.

---

## Charter Snapshot
- Reference `war_office.md` for the signed charter, veto powers, and ACK backlog (orders 012-013).
- Civilian oversight spans all ten Genesis workspaces (see `planning/pivotal_fronts/genesis_workspaces.md`) with R&D acting as the documentation origin.
- Safety infrastructure lives under `war_office/safety_protocols/` (kill switch stack, containment, incident templates).
- Every intervention must preserve the 70/30 play-to-devops ratio introduced in `new_major_pivots/new_major_pivot_1.md`.

---

## Current Signals (Nov-17 cycle)
- Orders 045 and 046 remain in reconciliation; see `README.md` for queue context and `exchange/reports/inbox/` for staged artifacts.
- Pivot Five rollout stays the headline priority: emoji-first compiler research (`new_major_pivots/new_major_pivot_5.md`) plus the Alfa composer build in `golf_00/delta_00/alfa_04/`.
- War Office Tenfold Genesis bundle was refreshed on 2025-11-14; mirror any changes downstream once documentation leaves draft state.

---

## Doc Refresh Queue Snapshot
*Source: `planning/commonwealth_loop/doc_refresh_queue.md` (2025-11-17 pull)*

**Already refreshed**
- Root `README.md` (offline continuity + Orders 045/046 status)
- `new_major_pivots/README.md`, Pivot Five tracker, alfa slot map, and the Toyfoundry/Toysoldiers guidance pair
- War Office Tenfold bundle (`planning/workspaces/war_office_ai_0/`, `planning/pivotal_fronts/genesis_workspaces.md`)

**Still open after this refresh**
1. `template.md` – tighten ledger logging instructions for new dispatches
2. `golf_00/delta_00/README.md` – align Alfa payload flow with the emoji translator prototype

**Logging expectations**
- After each refresh, append scope + actor + date to `exchange/ledger/2025-11.md`.
- Retire interim drafts in `exchange/orders/` only after acknowledgements clear; do **not** delete pending copies.

---

## Cross-Workspace Hooks
- `planning/commonwealth_loop/doc_refresh_queue.md` – authoritative queue for November; update this list before nudging other workspaces.
- `new_major_pivots/new_major_pivot_5.md` – policy reference for emoji-first computing and toddler co-play protocol.
- `planning/pivotal_fronts/genesis_workspaces.md` – describes how War Office mirrors propagate into the other nine Genesis hubs.
- `golf_00/delta_00/alfa_04/` – live build pad for the Alfa composer; War Office verifies operator-facing guardrails there.

---

## Directory Guide
- `war_office.md` – canonical charter + oversight framework
- `README.md` *(this file)* – situational awareness + queue summary for civilian operators
- `safety_protocols/` – emergency procedures, report templates, containment specification
- `../exchange/` – ledgers, orders, acknowledgements; follow `exchange/README.md` for automation routines

---

## Operating Notes
- Always encode War Office decisions back into `README.md` or `war_office.md` before issuing dispatches.
- When coordinating with Toyfoundry/Toysoldiers, ensure doc updates land here first, then mirror to their repositories to maintain oversight sequencing.
- Use the Alfa battlegrid overlay when presenting updates to human operators; if the workflow slips back into raw tooling, escalate immediately.
