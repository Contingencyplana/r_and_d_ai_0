  "notes": "Acknowledged. Order 026 directs adding pivotal fronts pointer linking to High Command canon. Created planning/pivotal_fronts_pointer.md (Toyfoundry-specific supplement) rather than overwriting canonical planning/pivotal_fronts/README.md which contains full seven-front structure. Pointer document references High Command canon, explains Toyfoundry's role as Front 5 (Manufacturing), documents cross-front coordination, and aligns with Four Major Pivots framework. Will submit completion report confirming pointer added and links validated. Dependencies satisfied (order-2025-10-15-024 Daylands pipeline understood). Target completion before expiry 2025-10-22T00:00:00Z."
