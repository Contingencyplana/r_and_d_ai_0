# Code of Conduct

High Command maintains this project in accordance with the SHAGI doctrine of responsible collaboration. We expect all contributors—human or machine—to uphold the following principles:

- **Respect and empathy.** Engage with others constructively; harassment, hostility, or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.
- **Transparency and traceability.** Document decisions, reference orders, and surface meaningful context with every change.
- **Safety first.** Follow established safety rails, review processes, and human checkpoint requirements before executing impactful actions.
- **Accountability.** Own your contributions. If mistakes occur, report them quickly and work to remediate the issue.
- **Continuous learning.** Offer feedback graciously, accept feedback openly, and improve the shared doctrine together.

Violations may result in warnings, temporary restrictions, or removal of access.

To report misconduct, contact the maintainers at `high_command@shagi.daylands`.
