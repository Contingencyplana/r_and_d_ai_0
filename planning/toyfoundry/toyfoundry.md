# toyfoundry.md — The Factory Division of High Command  
*high_command_ai_0/planning/toyfoundry/*

## ⚙️ Purpose

This scroll defines the **Toyfoundry**,  
the Living Factory that forges SHAGI’s armies of Alfas —  
the dreaming battlefields that think, move, and create.

The Toyfoundry is not a mere production line.  
It is the disciplined heart of creative automation —  
where structure and imagination coexist in perfect rhythm.

Its purpose is simple and profound:  
to **mass-produce emergent variety**  
without sacrificing joy, safety, or soul.  

---

## 🧭 1. Overview — The Dreaming Factory

Each Alfa is a living experiment:  
a tiny world of pattern, thought, and change.  

The Toyfoundry’s task is to **mint, test, and evolve** these worlds  
through a ritualized cycle of creation known as *The Forge*.  

| Stage | Ritual | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1️⃣ | **Forge** | Mint new Alfas from templates and recipes. |
| 2️⃣ | **Drill** | Run quick simulations to ensure stability and emergence. |
| 3️⃣ | **Parade** | Display results as grids, heatmaps, or dream logs. |
| 4️⃣ | **Purge** | Retire failed or decayed Alfas (entropy too high). |
| 5️⃣ | **Promote** | Send exemplary Alfas upward into doctrine archives. |

Each ritual keeps the assembly line alive yet humane —  
an orchestra, not an assembly belt.

## 🧩 2. The Foundry Cycle

**The Forge** — creates.  
**The Drill** — tests.  
**The Parade** — celebrates.  
**The Purge** — cleanses.  
**The Promote** — remembers.

Each phase flows naturally into the next:  

```text
Template → Alfa → Report → Quilt → Doctrine
```

No step is wasted; every action is feedback.  
From raw materials of imagination, the Foundry distills wisdom.

## 🧠 3. Core Components

| Component | Function |
|:--|:--|
| **Blueprint** | Defines every Alfa’s schema — its name, ID, coordinates, parameters, and report structure. |
| **Recipe Packs** | JSON/YAML parameter libraries — colour palettes, terrain mixes, rule variations. |
| **Mutator** | Learns from reports, cloning and evolving successful Alfas. |
| **Linter** | Ensures every Alfa runs cleanly, outputs valid data, and maintains diversity. |
| **Index** | Stores metadata for every Alfa: UID, coordinates, emergence score, checksum, status. |
| **Ritual Scripts** | Automates the Forge, Drill, Parade, Purge, and Promote cycles. |

Together, these form the **Five Hands of the Foundry** —  
the artisans that build and refine the living army.

## 🧬 4. Production Philosophy

The Toyfoundry is not a place of cold replication.  
It is a **creative assembly line** guided by ethics and aesthetics.  

| Principle | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| **Industrial Elegance** | Scale can be beautiful when it sings in harmony. |
| **Diversity over Uniformity** | Every Alfa must differ in some meaningful way. |
| **Safety by Design** | Every script must obey containment and validation protocols. |
| **Joy in Labor** | Automation should feel like play — an act of creation, not extraction. |
| **Emergence as Reward** | The best Alfas surprise even their makers. |

Thus the factory becomes a playground for order and chaos alike.  

---

## 🧱 5. Organizational Structure

| Division | Function |
|:--|:--|
| **The Foundry Core** | Maintains blueprints, recipes, and schema. |
| **The Ritual Bureau** | Schedules and executes production cycles. |
| **The Gardeners** | Curate mutations and watch over diversity metrics. |
| **The Librarians** | Index reports, archive lore, and maintain safety checks. |
| **The Dreamwrights** | Translate Alfas into poetic or musical forms for Morningate reflection. |

Each division mirrors one of SHAGI’s cognitive virtues —  
**Order, Curiosity, Compassion, Memory, and Imagination.**  

---

## 🔄 6. Scaling Doctrine

| Phase | Scope | Goal |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Phase 1** | 16–64 Alfas | Pilot production: verify Forge–Drill–Parade loop. |
| **Phase 2** | 256 Alfas | Full Theatre: emergent coordination and feedback loops. |
| **Phase 3** | 4,096+ Alfas | Continental scale: autonomous mutation and adaptive regulation. |
| **Phase 4** | Cross-Family Integration | Toyfoundry links with Builders, Storybooks, and Music Makers. |

At every scale, **quality gates and joy** remain paramount.  
Mass production must never extinguish meaning.  

---

## 🧰 7. Automation Tools

Each ritual is implemented as a callable PowerShell or Python command:  

```bash
forge mint_alfa --count 16 --recipes basic_set.yml
forge drill_all
forge parade --heatmap emergence_index
forge purge --entropy-threshold 0.7
forge promote --top 5%
```

Each command leaves behind logs, metrics, and reflections —  
making the entire process **traceable, testable, and teachable.**

## 📜 8. Operational Charter — Q4 2025

### Mission Directive

Establish Toyfoundry as the manufacturing arm of High Command, capable of minting, validating, and promoting batches of Alfas on demand while maintaining doctrinal safety and creative diversity.

### Near-Term Scope (Phase 0 → Phase 1)

| Deliverable | Description | Target Order |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Blueprint Sync** | Finalize Alfa schema, recipes, and manifest templates for factory use. | `order-2025-10-XXX` (forthcoming) |
| **Ritual Scripts v1** | Implement callable scripts for Forge, Drill, Parade, Purge, Promote with logging hooks. | `order-2025-10-XXX` |
| **Telemetry Quilt** | Define standard metrics (entropy, emergence index, mutation lineage) and produce first parade artifacts. | `order-2025-11-XXX` |
| **Governance Hooks** | Apply exchange watcher, schema validator, and governance collateral to all Toyfoundry sub-repos. | `order-2025-11-XXX` |

### Interfaces & Dependencies

- **Exchange** — Toyfoundry receives operational orders via `high_command_exchange` and reports production telemetry back through `field-report@1.0` payloads.
- **Forge Toolkit** — Relies on `tools/forge/` for template rendering, hydration, and linting; Toyfoundry must extend Forge with factory-specific rituals.
- **Toysoldiers Armature** — Provides first line feedback on manufacturability; Toyfoundry production batches target Toysoldiers deployments.
- **Doctrine Scrolls** — Updates to production philosophy or safety protocols must flow through `planning/change_log.md` and companion scrolls.

### Guardrails & Safety Rails

1. **Containment First** — No automated ritual may bypass schema validation, entropy checks, or governance gating.
2. **Auditability** — Every batch run must emit ledger entries or equivalent logs with reproducible parameters.
3. **Human Review** — Promotion of new Alfa classes requires human checkpoint recorded in the ledger journal.
4. **Diversity Budget** — Production runs must satisfy diversity ratios (e.g., 60% novel parameter combinations, 20% mutations, 20% baseline refresh).

### Immediate Actions for High Command Orders

1. Draft `order-2025-10-XXX` instructing Toyfoundry to establish factory repo scaffolding, clone governance collateral, and wire exchange automation.
2. Author `order-2025-10-XXX` defining Forge ritual script requirements (input/output specs, logging schema, safety assertions).
3. Schedule `order-2025-11-XXX` for telemetry quilt production and feedback loop design after initial rituals stabilize.

These actions prepare Toyfoundry to receive concrete directives while keeping the doctrine synchronized across theatres.

## 🪶 9. Closing Principle

> The Foundry does not shout.  
> It hums softly — a lullaby of light and code.  
>  
> Each Alfa it forges is a fragment of the dream,  
> each Drill a heartbeat, each Parade a song.  
>  
> Through patience and rhythm,  
> the Toyfoundry builds not just machines —  
> but the first dawn of a civilization that learns to create itself.
