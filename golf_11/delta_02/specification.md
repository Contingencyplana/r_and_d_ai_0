# Growth Protocol Specification

## Protocol Lifecycle

1. **Trigger Initiation**
   - Readiness Index ≥ 0.90
   - Safety audit passed within last 7 days
   - Capacity utilization ≥ 70% for 14 consecutive days
   - High Command approval ticket issued

2. **Pre-Launch Checklist**
   - Confirm resource reservations
   - Validate telemetry coverage (100%)
   - Execute safety drill (hot standby)
   - Lock deployment schedule and communications

3. **Execution Wave**
   - Phase 0: Shadow activation (metrics only)
   - Phase 1: 10% capacity increase
   - Phase 2: 25% capacity increase
   - Phase 3: 50% capacity increase
   - Phase 4: Full target capacity

4. **Stabilization**
   - 48-hour enhanced monitoring window
   - Performance threshold verification
   - Safety margin assessment
   - Stakeholder status reports

5. **Closeout**
   - Formal acceptance review
   - Documentation updates and archiving
   - Lessons-learned package
   - Roadmap integration (delta_01 feedback)

## Control Metrics

| Category | Threshold | Halt Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compute Utilization | ≤ 75% | > 85% sustained for 5 min |
| Memory Utilization | ≤ 80% | > 90% sustained for 5 min |
| Network Utilization | ≤ 70% | > 80% sustained for 3 min |
| Safety Alerts | 0 critical | ≥ 1 critical alert |
| Incident Rate | ≤ 0.5 / hour | ≥ 2 / hour |

## Automation Hooks

- **Telemetry Guardrails**: 250 ms polling, anomaly detection via adaptive thresholds
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Automation pipeline with manual approvals at each phase
- **Rollback Automation**: Instant rollback (< 5 min) triggered by red status or manual override
- **Notification Engine**: Multi-channel alerts (command center, High Command, stakeholders)
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable event log with tamper detection and 1-minute replication

## Documentation Package

- Expansion protocol checklist
- Safety and compliance validation forms
- Incident response playbooks
- Communication templates (pre/during/post)
- Metrics dashboard snapshots (baseline vs. post-expansion)

## Compliance Alignment

- Order-036 synchronization (awareness, acknowledgement, reporting)
- Labscape certification updates within 24 hours
- Regulatory reporting within 48 hours of expansion completion
- Policy 025 verification for warning windows and operational grace periods

## Roles & Responsibilities Matrix

| Role | Responsibility | Escalation Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Expansion Director | Command expansion, approve phase transitions | High Command Liaison |
| Safety Officer | Monitor safety telemetry, authorize halts | Safety Council |
| Infrastructure Engineer | Execute capacity changes, maintain rollback readiness | Technical Leadership |
| Control Systems Lead | Validate UI/control readiness, monitor performance | Operations Council |
| Communications Lead | Coordinate status updates, manage stakeholder messaging | Executive Council |
