   - 256 labscapes active
   - 1,048,576 AI units
   - Baseline technical infrastructure
   - 99.999% reliability target
   - < 1 ms control latency

2. **Growth (Phase 2)**
   - 512 labscapes provisioned
   - 2,097,152 AI units
   - Dual-region redundancy
   - 99.9995% reliability target
   - < 0.8 ms control latency

3. **Expansion (Phase 3)**
   - 1,024 labscapes staged
   - 4,194,304 AI units
   - Global replication capability
   - 99.9997% reliability target
   - < 0.6 ms control latency

4. **Full Deployment (Phase 4)**
   - 2,048 labscapes enabled
   - 8,388,608 AI units
   - Planetary-scale resiliency
   - 99.9999% reliability target
   - < 0.5 ms control latency

### Structural Domains

- **Compute Fabric**: Modular processing rings with 25% reserved headroom per expansion tier
- **Memory Grid**: Zoned memory pools with predictive pre-allocation and 85% utilization ceiling
- **Storage Spine**: Multi-tier storage hierarchy with 30% warm capacity buffer and 4x replication
- **Network Mesh**: 400 Gbps backbone with deterministic routing and < 0.5 ms failover
- **Safety Envelope**: Layered containment zones with automatic rollback on deviation > 2%

## Capacity Modeling

### Scaling Ratios

- Labscapes expansion ratio: 2× per tier with 12-week soak period
- AI unit onboarding ratio: 1:8 against labscape growth, capped at 90% of certified capacity
- Resource multiplier: compute 1.35×, memory 1.25×, storage 1.4×, network 1.5× per tier
- Safety telemetry density: +20% sensors per tier
- Control channel reserve: maintain 15% idle margin for surge commands

### Forecasting Inputs

- Utilization trends (30/60/90 day windows)
- Reliability posture score (> 99.995 before expansion)
- Safety compliance index (> 99.9 audit pass)
- Performance burn-down backlog (< 5 open issues)
- Emergency drill readiness (completed within prior 14 days)

## Scalability Metrics

| Metric | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provisioning window | < 4 hours | < 6 hours | < 8 hours | < 12 hours |
| Activation time | < 10 minutes | < 15 minutes | < 20 minutes | < 30 minutes |
| Rollback time | < 5 minutes | < 7 minutes | < 10 minutes | < 15 minutes |
| Safety verification | < 3 minutes | < 4 minutes | < 5 minutes | < 6 minutes |
| Telemetry sync | < 2 minutes | < 3 minutes | < 4 minutes | < 5 minutes |

## Safety Controls

### Pre-Expansion Gates

- Readiness score ≥ 0.92
- No critical incidents in previous 30 days
- All safety protocols validated within 7 days
- Backup systems synced within 24 hours
- Cross-domain sign-off (Architecture, Safety, Operations)

### Active Expansion Monitors

- Real-time anomaly detection (< 0.2 ms response)
- Auto-quarantine on deviation > 1.5%
- Multi-path rollback channels (hot, warm, cold)
- Independent safety observer service
- Live alerting to High Command bridges

## Implementation Stages

1. **Planning**: Scenario modeling, dependency mapping, readiness scoring
2. **Staging**: Pre-provision resources, run synthetic load, verify telemetry
3. **Activation**: Gradual ramp-up (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%), continuous validation
4. **Stabilization**: 72-hour monitoring window, performance baselining, safety audit
5. **Retrospective**: Post-expansion review, metric comparison, lessons integration
