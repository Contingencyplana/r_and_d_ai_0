# Expansion Architecture

## Purpose

Establish the foundational expansion architecture that allows the technical estate to scale from the current 256 labscapes and 1,048,576 AI units toward future capacity targets without compromising stability, safety, or performance.

## Scope

- Expansion-ready core architecture
- Capacity modeling across labscapes and AI units
- Scalability guardrails and thresholds
- Long-horizon infrastructure alignment
- Reliability preservation during growth

## Architectural Layers

### Core Expansion Layer

- Multi-phase capacity tiers (Phase 1â€“4)
- Dynamic provisioning model
- Resource abstraction framework
- Elastic infrastructure fabrics
- Cross-domain orchestration bus

### Support Systems Layer

- Growth-aware monitoring mesh
- Predictive capacity analytics
- Expansion-ready storage spine
- Adaptive network backplane
- Multi-region replication design

## Capacity Domains

### Labscape Scaling

- Tiered labscape onboarding workflow
- Automatic labscape registration
- Capacity certification steps
- Expansion readiness scoring
- Safety envelope verification

### AI Unit Scaling

- Batch and streaming provision paths
- Cognitive workload balancing
- Memory and compute reservation rules
- Safety-first activation pipeline
- Expansion rollback processes

## Integration Points

- Aligns with golf_08 intelligence enhancements
- Supports golf_09 control frameworks during expansion
- Consumes golf_10 infrastructure services
- Feeds golf_11 planning and protocol layers

## Safety Boundaries

- Growth gating by readiness index
- Expansion sandbox isolation
- Automated regression validation
- Multi-layer emergency halt mechanisms
- Continuous safety telemetry feedback
