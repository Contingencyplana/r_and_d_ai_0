# Expansion Planning Specification

## Planning Artifacts

### Roadmap Structure

1. **Portfolio View**
   - Phases: Foundation, Growth, Expansion, Full Deployment
   - Capacity targets with variance bands (±5%)
   - Dependency graph across domains
   - Risk and mitigation catalog
   - Executive summary and decision log

2. **Workstream View**
   - Infrastructure evolution milestones
   - Intelligence and control upgrades
   - Safety/security improvements
   - Operational readiness tasks
   - Training and enablement tracks

3. **Labscape View**
   - Onboarding sequence and prerequisites
   - Regional availability matrix
   - Compliance and safety checkpoints
   - Integration runbook references
   - Post-onboarding validation checklist

### Planning Cadence

| Cadence | Artefact | Owner | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monthly | Expansion Readiness Review | Expansion PMO | Readiness scorecard, capacity deltas |
| Quarterly | Strategic Alignment | Executive Council | Roadmap adjustments, budget confirmation |
| Semi-Annual | Safety & Compliance Audit | Safety Board | Policy updates, approval gates |
| Annual | Multi-Year Roadmap Refresh | Strategy Office | Long-term targets, investment plan |

## Analytical Models

- **Capacity Model**: Utilization thresholds (compute < 75%, memory < 80%, network < 70%)
- **Demand Forecast**: Weighted scenario blend (40% base, 35% growth, 25% stress)
- **Risk Model**: Likelihood × impact scoring with mitigation readiness index
- **Financial Model**: Capital versus operational expenditure ratio ≤ 60/40 per tier
- **Safety Model**: Compliance index ≥ 99.9 with automated variance alerts

## Decision Gates

1. **Gate 0 – Intake**
   - Business justification reviewed
   - Preliminary risk scan completed
   - High-level capacity check

2. **Gate 1 – Plan Approval**
   - Detailed roadmap drafted
   - Capabilities impact assessed
   - Safety/regulatory sign-off

3. **Gate 2 – Execution Launch**
   - Resources allocated and booked
   - Dependencies confirmed closed
   - Communication plan published

4. **Gate 3 – Expansion Closeout**
   - Objectives achieved and validated
   - Metrics captured and reported
   - Lessons integrated and archived

## Readiness Scoring

- **Readiness Index (RI)** = 0.35 × Capacity Health + 0.25 × Safety Compliance + 0.2 × Operational Preparedness + 0.2 × Risk Posture
- Thresholds: Proceed ≥ 0.90, Watch 0.80–0.89, Hold < 0.80
- Alerts triggered when sub-score drops by > 5% within a month

## Documentation Requirements

- Roadmap package (PDF + editable sources)
- Decision log with signatories
- Risk register updates and mitigation ownership
- Financial impact assessment and variance tracking
- Communication bundle (briefing, FAQ, stakeholder matrix)

## Tooling & Automation

- Unified planning workspace with audit trails
- Automated metric ingestion from telemetry systems
- Scenario planner with Monte Carlo simulations
- Safety compliance integration (Order-036 alignment)
- Reporting automation for High Command briefings
