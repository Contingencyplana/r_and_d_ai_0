## 2. Integration Assessment

### Cross-Delta Alignment

1. **Architecture ↔ Planning**
   - Expansion blueprint feeds roadmap prioritization and capacity modeling
   - Readiness scoring tied directly to architectural safety and capacity thresholds

2. **Protocols ↔ Evolution**
   - Growth protocol outcomes feed back into evolution knowledge base and planning updates
   - Continuous improvement loops adjust protocol guardrails and safety hooks

### Cross-Golf Dependencies

- Intelligence enhancements (golf_08) inform evolution decisions and planning assumptions
- UI/control readiness (golf_09) embedded within protocol checklists
- Technical infrastructure (golf_10) provides capacity metrics and safety limits
- Exchange operations synchronized through Order-036 compliance references

## 3. Critical Capability Validation

### Expansion Readiness

- ✓ Capacity tiers defined for Phases 1–4 with reliability and latency targets
- ✓ Resource multipliers and safety gates documented per tier
- ✓ Readiness Index formula established with proceed/hold thresholds

### Operational Execution

- ✓ Protocol lifecycle covers trigger → execution → stabilization → closeout
- ✓ Control metrics and halt triggers enforce operational safety
- ✓ Automation hooks ensure telemetry-backed operations and rapid rollback

### Continuous Evolution

- ✓ Innovation pipeline metrics set with stage lead-time targets
- ✓ Knowledge management process ensures decisions are traceable within 2 minutes
- ✓ Governance model spans monthly, quarterly, and annual reviews with cross-domain representation

## 4. Completion Status

### Implementation Verification

- All documentation deliverables produced for delta_00–delta_03
- Governance, safety, and compliance hooks aligned with charter directives
- Feedback loops established between planning, execution, and evolution layers

### Readiness Assessment

- Expansion program ready to guide Phase 2–4 scaling
- Safety-first posture preserved through readiness gates and continuous validation
- Mechanisms in place to integrate future innovations without service disruption

### Recommendation

✓ golf_11 Future Expansion block is complete, validated, and ready to drive long-horizon growth while maintaining the safety and reliability commitments of the R&D charter.
