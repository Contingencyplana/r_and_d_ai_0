# Evolution Systems Specification

## Continuous Evolution Cycle

1. **Discover**
   - Horizon scanning across technology, policy, and operational signals
   - Intake channels: research labs, partner ecosystems, regulatory bodies
   - Opportunity triage matrix (impact × feasibility × urgency)

2. **Assess**
   - Proof-of-concept evaluation within isolated environments
   - Risk and safety impact assessment
   - Cost-benefit and resource requirement analysis
   - Stakeholder alignment and approval

3. **Adopt**
   - Controlled rollout plan with labscape cohorts
   - Training and enablement packages
   - UI/control updates and communication kits
   - Telemetry baselining and monitoring hooks

4. **Evolve**
   - Continuous performance tracking
   - Iterative improvement backlog
   - Retirement or scale decisions
   - Knowledge capture and dissemination

## Innovation Pipeline Metrics

| Stage | Lead Time Target | Success Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discover | < 14 days | Opportunity logged and triaged |
| Assess | < 30 days | Risk, cost, benefit analysis complete |
| Adopt | < 45 days | Pilot executed, results reported |
| Evolve | Continuous | Performance ≥ baseline + 10% |

## Knowledge Management

- Evolution knowledge base updated within 48 hours of decision
- Versioned playbooks with changelog and rollback steps
- Quarterly digest circulated to High Command and labscape leads
- Tagging across domains (technology, safety, operations, policy)
- Integration with exchange ledger for audit and traceability

## Safety & Compliance Hooks

- Mandatory safety impact review for every innovation
- Compliance matrix mapping to Order-036 and policy updates
- Automated regression packs executed prior to adoption
- Fallback procedures validated before rollout
- Dual-approval requirement (Safety + Operations) for live deployment

## Tooling Ecosystem

- Innovation tracking board with workflow automation
- Experimentation sandbox tied to telemetry analytics
- Documentation portal with collaborative authoring and review
- Change notification system integrated with command centers
- Metrics dashboard for evolution KPIs (adoption rate, benefit realization, safety variance)

## Reporting & Governance

- Monthly evolution status report (pipeline health, key decisions)
- Quarterly innovation outcomes review with High Command
- Annual strategic evolution update embedded into planning cycle
- KPI thresholds: evolution benefit ≥ 12% annual uplift, implementation variance ≤ 5%
- Audit readiness: all evolution decisions traceable within < 2 minutes
