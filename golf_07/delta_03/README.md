# Security Communications System

## Purpose

This module implements a comprehensive secure messaging and alert system for the Labscape network, ensuring encrypted, reliable, and real-time security communications across all environments.

## Scope

1. Communication Coverage
   - 256 Labscape environments
   - Real-time security alerts
   - Cross-system coordination
   - Redundant channels

2. Message Types
   - Security alerts
   - Threat notifications
   - Response coordination
   - Status updates

## Integration Framework

1. Alert Distribution
   - Real-time propagation
   - Priority-based routing
   - Cross-system coordination
   - Redundant channels

2. Response Coordination
   - Immediate acknowledgment
   - Status verification
   - Action confirmation
   - System synchronization
