# Security Protocol Design

## Purpose

This module establishes comprehensive security protocol frameworks for the Labscape network, defining hierarchical security structures, threat detection mechanisms, and coordinated response systems across all environments.

## Scope

1. Protocol Coverage
   - 256 Labscape environments
   - Multi-layer security protocols
   - Nested protection systems
   - Cross-system coordination

2. Protocol Hierarchy
   - Level 1: AI Unit Security
   - Level 2: Labscape Security
   - Level 3: Cross-Labscape Security
   - Level 4: Network-Wide Security

## Integration Framework

1. Cross-System Security
   - Protocol synchronization
   - Response coordination
   - Security alignment
   - Status verification

2. System Coordination
   - Real-time communication
   - Protocol propagation
   - Security validation
   - Threat response

## Implementation Structure

1. Protocol Deployment
   - Hierarchical implementation
   - Security activation
   - Response coordination
   - Recovery procedures

2. Validation Framework
   - Protocol testing
   - Security verification
   - System confirmation
   - Integration validation

## Protocol Categories

1. Authentication Protocols
