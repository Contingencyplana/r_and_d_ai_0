# Core Security Architecture

## Purpose

This module establishes the foundational security framework for the Labscape network, implementing comprehensive protection mechanisms for all AI units and system components across 256 environments.

## Core Components

1. Multi-Layer Security
   - Perimeter defense systems
   - Network security layers
   - Application security
   - Data protection mechanisms

2. AI Unit Security
   - Individual unit isolation
   - Access control systems
   - Behavior monitoring
   - Threat containment

3. System Protection
   - Infrastructure security
   - Resource protection
   - Service safeguards
   - Component isolation
