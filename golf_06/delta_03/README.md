# Safety Communications System

## Purpose

This module implements a comprehensive safety alert and emergency communication system for the Labscape network, ensuring real-time propagation of critical safety information and coordinated emergency responses across all environments.

## Scope

1. Alert Coverage
   - 256 Labscape environments
   - Real-time emergency broadcasts
   - Cross-system coordination
   - Redundant communication paths

2. Communication Types
   - Emergency alerts
   - Safety broadcasts
   - Status updates
   - Response coordination

## Integration Framework

1. Alert Propagation
