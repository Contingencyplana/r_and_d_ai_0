## 2. Integration Assessment

### Cross-Delta Alignment

1. **Architecture ↔ Specifications**
   - Component definitions map cleanly to design blueprints
   - Capacity metrics inherit from architecture headroom assumptions
   - Safety thresholds consistent across documents

2. **Protocols ↔ Communications**
   - Resource and failover protocols surface directly into messaging flows
   - Monitoring cadence synchronized with protocol validation checkpoints
   - Alert propagation honors priority schema defined in delta_02

### Safety & Reliability Checks

- Multi-layer redundancy captured in architecture, enforced through protocols
- Communications layer ensures 99.999% delivery guarantees and < 0.5 ms telemetry latency
- Failover procedures validated through recovery time objectives (≤ 10 ms for critical paths)

### Control & Monitoring Interfaces

- System protocols feed UI/control expectations in golf_09
- Communications fabric exposes metrics to exchange and High Command workflows
- Standardized data formats maintain compatibility with intelligence and safety domains

## 3. Critical Capability Validation

### Capacity & Performance
